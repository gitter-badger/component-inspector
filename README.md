![Example for React](http://s63.imgup.net/ci-introcbc0.gif)

General purpose of tool is showing components boundaries and its DOM fragment with some details. It could be extended by features like [source fragment locating](#locating-components-source) and [opening file in editor](#opening-file-in-editor). See [Additional features](#additional-features) section for details.

It's still a **proof of concept**. Generally it's an adoptation of [basis.js](https://github.com/basisjs/basisjs) tool for other component frameworks and libraries. Here is ready to use builds for [React](#react) and [Backbone](#backbone). But you also could [use inspector with custom API](#api-free-build) for your own component solution.

## Install

```
npm install component-inspector --save-dev
```

## Usage

There are 3 options to use Component Inspector:

- use one of ready-to-use build for certain framework or library
- use API free build and init inspector with custom API
- make you own build as ready-to-use solution (PRs are welcome)

### Ready to use builds

In case you use one of ready-to-use editions (i.e. `React` or `Backbone`) there is no any public API. Just include apropriate script and here you are.

#### React

![React example](http://u12.imgup.net/ScreenShot5cce.png)

You should include `component-inspector` script **before** `React` script.

```html
<script src="node_modules/component-inspector/dist/react.js"></script>
<script src="react.js"></script>
```

#### Backbone

![Backbone example](http://i60.imgup.net/backbone2e57.png)

You should include `component-inspector` script right **after** `Backbone` script.

```html
<script src="backbone.js"></script>
<script src="node_modules/component-inspector/dist/backbone.js"></script>
```

### API free build

In case you want to use inspector with your own API adapter you should use `dist/base.js` script. When script included into html only one public function available â€“ `initComponentInspector(api)`. This function could be invoked just once. It takes API methods that override defaults.

```html
<script src="node_modules/component-inspector/dist/base.js"></script>
<script>
  initComponentInspector({
    isComponentRootNode: function(node){
      return Boolean(node && node.__view);
    },
    getInstanceByNode: function(node){
      if (node) {
        return node.__view;
      }
    },
    getInstanceRootNode: function(instance){
      if (instance) {
        return instance.rootNode;
      }
    }
  });
</script>
```

All methods are optional. Most important method is `isComponentRootNode` that checks DOM node is component root node. Also `getInstanceByNode` and `getInstanceRootNode` could be used to resolve DOM fragment owner (component instance) and owners root element. Other methods could provide additional information.

#### isComponentRootNode(node)

Returns `true` if DOM node is root node of some component. Uses to determine component boundaries.

#### getComponentNameByNode(node)

Returns component name if possible. This name using in component short details.

#### getInstanceByNode(node)

Function to resolve component owner by DOM node if any. Usually it's some kind of `view` instance.

#### getInstanceRootNode(instance)

Should return instance's root DOM node. It's vice versa function of `getInstanceByNode(node)`. Using on DOM mutations to determine actual DOM node to inspect, as root DOM node could be changed on component re-render.

#### getInstanceClass(instance)

Should returns reference to instance class. Returns `instance.constructor` by default.

#### getInstanceLocation(instance)

Returns instance source location if possible. Normally no need to override it, as it returns `api.getLocation(instance)` by default.

#### getInstanceRenderLocation(instance)

By default it returns source location of `instance.render` method. You can override it if needed.

#### getNodeLocation(node)

If there is source location where DOM node was created this function should returns it. Uses in DOM viewer when hover nodes.

#### getNestedComponentNameByNode(node)

Used in DOM viewer to get name for nested components. Override function if those names should be provided.

#### getNestedComponentNodeLocation(node)

Allow provide location for nested component root node. If not defined `getNodeLocation` is used.

#### domAttributeFilter(attribute)

Allow to filter output attributes in DOM viewer. For example, React adds `data-reactid` attribute to every element, but we don't want to show it. In this case, method could be:

```js
domAttributeFilter: function(attr){
  return attr.name !== 'data-reactid';
}
```

#### showDefaultInfo()

Show default info block or not. True by default.

#### getAdditionalInstanceInfo(instance)

Allow provide additional info for related objects. Should provide array of objects or nothing. For example, provide instance model info:

```js
api.getAdditionalInstanceInfo = function(instance){
  if (instance && instance.model) {
    return [{
      name: 'Model',
      locations: [
        { type: 'instance', loc: this.getLocation(instance.model) },
        { type: 'class', loc: this.getLocation(instance.model.constructor) }
      ]
    }];
  }
};
```

#### getLocation(value)

Should returns source location, where value was defined. By default return `loc` value from `getDevInfo()`

#### getDevInfo(value[, property])

Function provides dev info attached to value. It should returns info as is if no `property` argument and property value otherwise.

```js
getDevInfo(value);
// { "loc": "file.js:1:2:3:4", ... }

getDevInfo(value, 'loc');
// "file.js:1:2:3:4"
```

#### isOpenFileSupported()

Returns `true` if `open file in editor` is supported. In this case click by source location links will call `openFile` method.

#### openFile(filename)

Should make some action to open specified filename in editor.

### Make your own build

You can make your own ready-to-use edition, see [React](src/react.js) or [Backbone](src/backbone.js) as examples.

#### Implementation

First of all, you should include `basis.js` core (as inspector was originaly implemented using it) in your base html file and specify path to your implementation module.

```html
<script src="node_modules/component-inspector/node_modules/basisjs/src/basis.js" basis-config="
  noConflict: true,    // prevents export names to global scope
  devpanel: false,
  modules: {
    myapi: {           // your implementation module
      autoload: true,
      filename: 'path/to/implementation.js'
    }
  }
"></script>
```

Example of `implementation.js`:

```js
var initInspector = require('./inspector/index.js');

initInspector({
  isComponentRootNode: function(node){
    // ..
  },
  getInstanceByNode: function(node){
    // ..
  },
  getInstanceRootNode: function(instance){
    // ..
  }
});
```

#### Build

Install `basisjs-tools`

```
npm install basisjs-tools --save-dev
```

Run build with `--single-file` option.

```
node node_modules/basisjs-tools/bin/basis --file path/to/myinspector.html --single-file --pack --same-filenames
```

As result you'll get single JavaScript file (`myinspector.js` in this example) that contains everything. Include this script in your application page.

## Additional features

Component inspector shows component bounds and its DOM fragment only. But more details could be shown if some sort of meta-data (like source code locations) is available.

There is example of default view for React component:

![Component inspector w/o instrumenting](http://v03.imgup.net/ScreenShotb2f6.png)

Compare it to the same view but with meta-data available:

![Component inspector with instrumenting](http://o52.imgup.net/ScreenShot199c.png)

Interface to get meta-data should be called `$devinfo` with at least single method `get()`. Inspector expects `get` method returns object or falsy value if no data.

```js
window.$devinfo = {
  get: function(ref){
    // return some information for `ref`
  }
};
```

If API has name other than `$devinfo`, you can specify it's name by defining global variable `DEVINFO_API_NAME`.

```js
window.DEVINFO_API_NAME = 'customApiName';
```

You could use ready-to-use [babel plugin](https://github.com/restrry/babel-plugin-source-wrapper) that instruments source code and provides necessary API. See ([documentation](https://github.com/restrry/babel-plugin-source-wrapper)) for details. You free to implement your own solution and use plugin implementation as reference.

### Locating component's source

When meta-data object is available for inspecting value, inspector expects location is storing in `loc` property as string `filename:startLine:startColumn:endLineEnd:endColumn`.

```js
window.$devinfo.get(obj);
// > { "loc": "app.js:...", ... }
```

If value definition source location is found some additional features became available: [fetching source fragments](#fetching-source-fragments) and [opening file in editor](opening-file-in-editor).

### Fetching source fragments

Component inspector includes solution for retrieving original source code and highlight it. It's all possible if value location provided.

How does it works:

- retrieve source code by request to server for original filename (or get it from cache if `basisjs-tools` server is used)
- extract original source code with aware of source maps
- cache the result
- highligh code
- get required source fragment and show it in popup

Since original files are fetching by request to server, make sure those files are available for downloading by your server.

> NOTE: Take in account if source file was changed since downloaded by browser, inspector could show wrong (outdated) source fragment. Page refresh should solve the problem.

> NOTE: Support for external or server API for source fragment extraction is coming in next releases (see [issue](https://github.com/lahmatiy/component-inspector/issues/10)).

### Opening file in editor

In case dev-server supports `opening in editor` feature, all location references become active links. A click on any of those opens a file in editor with cursor set at the start of the code fragment. You'll see a hint if feature is supported.

One possible way to provide this feature is set global variable `OPEN_FILE_URL`.

```js
window.OPEN_FILE_URL = '/open-in-editor';
```

When location link is clicked inspector sends request to server (see [implementation](https://github.com/lahmatiy/component-inspector/blob/master/src/inspector/api/file.js) for details):

```
GET /open-in-editor?file=/path/to/file.js:1:2:3:4
```

> NOTE: Take in account if source file was changed since downloaded by browser, inspector could "open" file on wrong (outdated) position. Page refresh should solve the problem.

There are options to provide `opening in editor` feature on server:

- `express` extension [express-open-in-editor](https://github.com/lahmatiy/express-open-in-editor), that also could be used with [webpack-dev-server](https://github.com/lahmatiy/express-open-in-editor#using-with-webpack-dev-server).
- in case you don't depend on dev-server, you can use [basisjs-tools](https://github.com/basisjs/basisjs-tools) that provides this feature out of box
- roll your own implementation for your dev-server using [open-in-editor](https://github.com/lahmatiy/open-in-editor)
